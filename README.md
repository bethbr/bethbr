# About me


**bethbr/bethbr** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on providing linked health data in an NHS TRE
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of python, and how to use Github!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on SDC under the 5 safes framework
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with automating more of the basics
